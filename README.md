# Notes
* Project is Maven based. For best results import the pom.xml file into your IDE. This should ensure all packages are correctly loaded and compiled. https://vaadin.com/tutorials/import-maven-project-eclipse 
* Documentation is in the docs folder
* Assignment 3 has a separate class diagram. This is because having a single class diagram for both assignments 2 and 3 would have become too complex to easily read. Relationships to classes from assignment 2 are included where relevant in the assignment 3 class diagram.
